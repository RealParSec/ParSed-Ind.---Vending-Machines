## What is this?
This is addon for game called Garry's Mod that was originally sold on GmodStore, but due to me not having not enough time I decided to release it on github for free for everyone to use.

## Is this still maintained?
Yes this version is still maintained and will be kept maintained, in fact this version was modified to make it more secure and more reliable.

## Plans for the future...
My plans for this is to modify this to the point it won't need any hacky solutions to work and to fix my old mistakes.
But the list of my plans is below:
* Fix the code to the point it won't need any hacky solutions
* Release on the workshop (this will happen once the code is stable enough and don't need much sh** to work)
* Add in-game config
* If you have any more sugestions than open an issue
