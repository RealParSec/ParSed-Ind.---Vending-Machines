## What is this?
This is addon for game called Garry's Mod that was originally sold on GmodStore, but due to me not having not enough time I decided to release it on github for free for everyone to use.

## Is it diffrent from the version that was sold on GMS?
In terms of functionality... no. In terms of backend code... yes, it has been hardened and should be more resistant to any type of exploiting due to the fact that this one doesn't use any unneeded client <=> server communication.

## Warning
No matter how you look at this, this addon is pretty old and have not been updated for while so use at your own discretion.

## Needed to run...
